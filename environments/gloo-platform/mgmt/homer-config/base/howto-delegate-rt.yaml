          Portal Demo Walkthrough:

          Backstage:
          Description: Use the Gloo Platform Portal Backstage frontend plug-in to create a developer portal frontend for your developers so that they can view and access your REST API catalog.
          This demo uses Backstages as an example of an internal developer portal use-case. The APIs exposed through Gloo Gateway with the label `portal: internal` are automatically populated in
          the Backstage catalog. The APIs can be secured using external auth and rate limiting policies to implement a usage plan (i.e. 15 req/min) mapped to a grouping of users (i.e. bronze, silver, gold)

          1. Navigate to the Backstage UI > Gloo Portal > APIs tab to see publicly available APIs
          2. Review the Redoc and Swagger views for the APIs and note that the APIs are secured with Gloo Platform ExtAuthPolicy
          3. Navigate to the Backstage UI > Gloo Portal > Overview tab to log in
             - Use the username/password: `jdoe@solo.io`/`gloo-dev`
          4. Note that the logged in user now has access to the Usage Plans tab
          5. Generate an API Key
          6. Navigate to the API associated with the API Key > Swagger UI > Authorize > Enter the API Key
          7. Now you can use the try-it-now feature to test the API
          8. Note that the API Key is rate limited after 15 requests/minute

          React External Portal Demo:

          Description: This is an example Solo.io Gloo Platform Dev Portal frontend app, built with Vite, and configured to use React and Typescript. 
          It can be used to view information about your APIs and usage plans, add or delete API keys, and view your OpenAPI schemas using an embedded 
          Redoc UI or Swagger UI view. It also can be personalized with images and colors to match your branding and preferences. The use case for this
          demo is similar to above, but serves as an external customer facing portal where the focus is more on accessing and consuming otherwise protected
          APIs. The APIs exposed through Gloo Gateway with the label `portal: external` are automatically populated in this External Portal.

          1. Navigate to the React Portal Frontend UI > APIs tab as an unauthenticated user to see that the APIs are not visible
          2. Login through Okta with the username/password: `jdoe@solo.io`/`gloo-dev`
          3. Note that the logged in user now has APIs available to view
          4. Select the User icon > API Keys tab and generate an API Key for a product
          5. Navigate to the API associated with the API Key > Swagger UI > Authorize > Enter the API Key
          7. Now you can use the try-it-now feature to test the API
          8. Note that the API Key is rate limited based on usage plan used (i.e. bronze, silver, gold)


          Clickhouse Portal Analytics:
          Description: More information in the Docs: https://docs.solo.io/gloo-gateway/latest/portal/admin/monitor/
          As an API product owner, you can collect analytics about your API usage. This way, you can identify ways to better monetize your API products 
          based on actual usage. When the end user queries one of your APIs, your Gloo Gateway handles the request. You can enable the gateway to generate access logs. 
          This way, the Open Telemetry (OTel) metrics pipeline that you set up can store the access logs in a Clickhouse storage database. As the Portal admin, you 
          can then view usage information for your API products in the Gloo UI through a Grafana dashboard.

          1. Navigate to the Clickhouse Portal Analytics tab to see recent API Product usage globally. If you have been using the previous demos, you should see some usage.
          2. Note that these metrics are coming from the OTEL pipeline and can be configured declaratively using Helm values.
          3. This dashboard is tracking Geo-IP information, which can be seen on the map. (Scroll to US)
          4. Access logs are also captured and displayed in the recent requests panel

          Argo Rollouts Demo Walkthrough:

          Gloo Mesh Argo Rollouts Plugin:
          At Solo.io, we've integrated Argo Rollouts' traffic management capabilities with Gloo Mesh's advanced routing 
          mechanisms through a supported plugin. organizations can ensure a smooth and controlled transition from one version 
          of an application to the next, minimizing downtime and reducing the risk of disruptions. This allows teams to adopt 
          advanced deployment strategies like canary releases and blue-green deployments, allowing for safe experimentation 
          with new features and configurations. The result? Faster innovation cycles, higher customer satisfaction, 
          and ultimately, a stronger market position for the organization.

          Additional Links:
          https://github.com/ably77/gloo-platform-argo-rollouts-blog

          Progressive Delivery Demo:
          1. In two separate windows (side-by-side) open up the Argo Rollouts Demo Dashboard and the Argo Rollouts Demo App
          2. In the Argo Rollouts Demo Dashboard select the rollouts-demo tile
          3. in the Containers tile on the top right, change the image tag to another color such as blue > green, any color should work. 
             (i.e. argoproj/rollouts-demo:green) and click save. This will automatically trigger a new progressive rollout of the application
          4. In the Argo Rollouts Demo App, you will start to see the new version of the application being deployed, mapped to the weights specified
             in the rollout manifest as the blue squares start to shift to green squares.
          5. In the Argo Rollouts Demo Dashboard you can also see the progress steps in the left hand sidebar
          6. Once the rollout is complete, you can see the new version of the application deployed in the Argo Rollouts Demo App


          Rollback Demo:
          1. To demonstrate a rollback, change the image to a color tag prefixed with `bad-` such as `argoproj/rollouts-demo:bad-yellow`
          2. This will trigger a new progressive rollout of the application. You will see that the new yellow squares in the demo app will
             have a red border around them, indicating an app that is causing errors. (non-200)
          3. Argo Rollouts will automatically detect this and rollback to the previous stable version of the application. If you take a look
             at the AnalysisTemplate you will see that the rollout failed the analysis step which requires < 5% of the traffic to be non-200.
          4. Note that these metrics are coming from the Istio metrics that are queried using Prometheus
          5. To reset the demo, switch the image back to a stable state, preferrably `argoproj/rollouts-demo:blue` for the next demo
          
          Argo CD UI:
          Argo CD is not required in order to use Argo Rollouts, but can be integrated together to provide a UI for managing GitOps deployments.
          The following steps demonstrate how the two projects are well integrated and how they can be used together.
          
          1. Open the Argo CD UI in a third window and search for wave-rollouts-demo-aoa. The Argo CD UI is another place to watch the
          rollout in action.
          2. When triggering a new rollout, watch the Argo CD UI to see rollout steps as they progress. You should see a new pod being deployed as
             part of the Rollout, and a new AnalysisTemplate that gets created
          3. Select the `rollouts-demo-rt-443` RouteTable tile to see that the Argo Rollouts plugin is controlling the weights of the routes according
             to the steps defined in the rollout manifest
          4. Selecting the `rollouts-demo` Rollout tile you can see the live manifest to see the declarative configuration of the rollout
          5. Additionally, if you select the more tab, you will see the integrated read-only version of the Argo Rollouts Demo Dashboard used earlier
          6. Discuss that in theory, if the sync on this Argo Application was turned on, that the rollout could be triggered by a git commit to the repo
             and synced automatically.

          Multicluster Tiered App Demo Walkthrough:

          Description: 
          This demo shows a tiered application deployed across glooplatform-central and glooplatform-east, where the central region cluster holds the
          "core" application which is self-contained in this region. The east region cluster extends the core application across multiple clusters and regions over mTLS.
          This architecture provides flexibility for application deployments or migration patterns. For example, the developers in the glooplatform-east cluster can 
          leverage the complete set of core application features, as well as extend the application with additional features that are only relevant to the east region.
          For migrations, this architecture can be used for a phased migration of the core application from cluster to cluster by using a strangler pattern approach where
          components of the core application can be migrated to the east region cluster in a phased approach.

          1. Select the Tiered Mesh Application tile to see the `/ns-1/ui` endpoint. Note that you can also use the `/ns-1` endpoint directly to see the direct API output
          2. Note that you can also explore the other namespaces as well by changing between `/ns-1` and `/ns-4` endpoints
          3. Select the Tiered Mesh Application - Gloo UI tile to open up the Gloo Mesh UI service graph
          4. Note that the service graph shows the core application in the central region cluster, and the extended application in the east region cluster
          5. Navigate to the strangler-pattern service UI in your browser at `/east/ns-1-ui` to see the extended application in the east region cluster
          6. Note that the strangler-pattern service calls services in glooplatform-central as well as additional services in the local cluster as part of the
             call chain. This can be visualized in the graph by the arrow direction from `strangler-pattern` to `throbbing-field`
          7. Discuss advantages of this architecture for migrations and flexibility for developers
